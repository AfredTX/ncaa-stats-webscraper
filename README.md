# NCAA Basketball Stats Webscrapper
> Collects team stats for the top 68 NCAA basketball teams and writes them to a preformatted Excel spreadsheet.

This Python script uses the Request and Beautiful Soup libraries to collect team stats from teamrankings.com and kenpom.com and creates a series of lists and dictionaries to contain the information.
With the help of the Pandas and Openpyxl libraries, the various team stats are written to a preformatted Excel spreadsheet.
